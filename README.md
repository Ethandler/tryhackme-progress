# TryHackMe Progress Tracker

This is my personal log of progress through TryHackMe as I learn ethical hacking, cybersecurity fundamentals, and offensive security techniques. My goal is to go from student to security pro — and prove it one room at a time.

## 🧠 Notes & Wins
- **Mar 29, 2025:** Completed "Offensive Security Intro"  
  Like a builder picking up a lockpick. First room, first move. No turning back.
- **Mar 29, 2025:** Completed "Defensive Security Intro"
  Learned about the difference between Red and Blue teams and got to simulate a workflow of a common task for Blue Team, also learned which upper staff members to bring concerns/ requests for permissions to.
