## Room 1: Offensive Security Intro  
**Status:** Completed  
**Date:** March 29, 2025

### Room Summary:
Kicked off the Pre-Security Path with the Offensive Security Intro.  
Learned the foundational mindset behind ethical hacking and what paths exist in cybersecurity.  
Set the tone for breaking systems to build better ones.

---

### Tools Encountered:
- TryHackMe platform
- GoBuster 

### Tools Mastered:
- Terminal basics (navigation and interaction)
- Understanding offensive security philosophy

### Journal:
Started the first room of the Pre-Security path. 
Felt like this was exactly where I needed to beginâ€”legit inspiring to hear how others transitioned into cyber from totally unrelated fields. 
The focus wasnâ€™t on tools yet, more on mindset and mapping the battlefield.

## Room 2: Defensive Security Intro
**Status:** Completed  
**Date:** March 29, 2025

### Room Summary:
Took my first steps on the blue team side of cyber. 
Learned how defenders identify and respond to threats, detect intrusions, and investigate shady activity. 
Broke down SOC roles, malware analysis, DFIR, and ran a simulated SIEM like a real analyst. 
Ended with a flag in hand and some new appreciation for how hard defense hits.

### Tools Encountered:

â€¢ TryHackMe SIEM Simulator

â€¢ Static and Dynamic Malware Analysis Concepts

â€¢ Flag pattern parsing

### Tools Mastered:

â€¢ Threat detection through alert correlation

â€¢ Understanding SOC workflows

â€¢ Incident response phases (Preparation, Detection, Containment, Recovery)

### Journal:

What surprised me most was how much goes into catching a threat after it already landed. 
I always pictured the red team having the more technical challenge, but damn, blue team ops require sharp eyes, solid documentation, and serious pattern recognition. 
The real power move here was seeing how DFIR breaks down and maps the attack like a story.
It felt less like learning a tool and more like learning how to think like a responder. 
And the SIEM sim? Honestly kinda fun.
