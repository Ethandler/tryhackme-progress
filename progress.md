# TryHackMe Progress Tracker – Ethan Blankenship (SolHacker)

## Room 1: Offensive Security Intro  
**Status:** Completed  
**Date:** March 29, 2025

### Room Summary:
Kicked off the Pre-Security Path with the Offensive Security Intro.  
Learned the foundational mindset behind ethical hacking and what paths exist in cybersecurity.  
Set the tone for breaking systems to build better ones.

---

### Tools Encountered:
- TryHackMe platform (Web-based virtual machine)
- GoBuster (discussed but not used in this room)

### Tools Mastered:
- Terminal basics (navigation and interaction)
- Understanding offensive security philosophy

### Journal:
Started the first room of the Pre-Security path. Felt like this was exactly where I needed to begin—legit inspiring to hear how others transitioned into cyber from totally unrelated fields. The focus wasn’t on tools yet, more on mindset and mapping the battlefield.
